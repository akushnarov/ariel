description: 'Ariel is a cutting-edge solution designed to address the growing need for multilingual advertising. Our platform empowers advertisers to expand their reach and engagement by automatically translating and dubbing video ads into multiple languages. This innovative technology significantly reduces the time and cost associated with traditional translation and voiceover processes, while preserving the original voice, emotion, and brand identity across language barriers.

Ariel offers a seamless user experience. Advertisers simply upload their video ad in their source language, and the platform automatically generates high-quality dubbed versions in the desired target languages, complete with accurate lip synchronization. Our system also enables minor script adjustments during translation to ensure cultural relevance and idiomatic accuracy, delivering culturally-sensitive and effective ads to global audiences.'
